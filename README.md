# NSF-DS-Prep

This is a repository where I will upload all of my code from CS 171 - Intro to Machine Learning and Data Mining, from UCR. 
In addition to the code, I will also be uploading practice problems, and notes; as well as small projects that will help me get more practice with Python and Pythorch prior to my Summer Research Internship.
