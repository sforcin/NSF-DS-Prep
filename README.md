# NSF-DS-Prep

This is a repository where I will upload all of my code from CS 171 - Intro to Machine Learning and Data Mining, from UCR. 
In addition to the code, I will also be uploading practice problems, and notes; as well as small projects that will help me get more practice with Python and Pythorch prior to my Summer Research Internship. 


***Areas of Interest***
In my experience with Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, and Calculus, the following are my areas of interest:
- Graphs [Bipartite Graphs, Graph Traversals, Graph Theory]
- Algorithms
- Linear Algebra Topics such as Matrices
- Computer Vision [although I don't have much experience]
- Data Modeling [At a smaller scale, I always liked finding patterns in things and creating simple models for it. I enjoyed creating KNN, Neural Nets and Classification Algorithms in CS 171]
- I also like anything related to doing math by hand. I truly enjoyed everything related to calculations in CS 171. I enjoyed tree pruning, Neural Networks calculations, and everything that was not an algorithm!
